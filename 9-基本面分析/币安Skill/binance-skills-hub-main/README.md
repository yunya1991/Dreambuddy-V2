# Binance Skills Hub

Binance Skills Hub is an open skills marketplace that gives AI agents native access to crypto: both centralized and decentralized. Search tokens, execute trades, track wallets, monitor signals, and interact with DeFi protocols, all through natural language.

Built by Binance. Built for everyone.

We're not building this just for Binance products. Skills Hub is designed for the entire crypto ecosystem: any agent, any framework, any chain. Whether you're building on LangChain, CrewAI, or your own stack, your agents can plug into crypto with a few lines of config.
